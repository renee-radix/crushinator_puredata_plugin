# crushinator_puredata_plugin
Requires puredata with else library to run, or plugdata. Use with plugdata to run in a DAW (as intended): https://plugdata.org/. 

Owes a lot to else library. Mostly made to fill a need that I've been having for something to totally destroy my saxophone sound, uploaded here in case anyone else has a use for it.
